# -  Hi, Iâ€™m @User-Alnz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a french dev currently in professional reconversion. 
I've found my new hobbie by coding on my own. having started with js I keep going on my path ðŸ›¤

I'm willing to face new challenges but I'm mainly eager to learn. I love coding because there is always room for learning and soliving problem which is what I like ðŸ˜Ž

If you are a recruiter please take time to read carefully what is written below (2 min max to read it): 

As an old Customer Success Manager, I have already been a stakeholder of a SAAS. having been on client side, my experience taught me from far but enough to be impacted by the importance of good code base.
Coding now, I have today understood how it's important to write a clean code, in way the code must be easy to understand and thus to maintain or to implement.
I have seen how each update or new version released can be harmful due to regression, dependence, etc ... And I have already heard dev team talking to refactoring the whole code ...
Further than just wasting time refactoring the code base we talking about cost, and this would be really painfull espacially for small compagnies. 
This is especially what we all want to avoid!

I force myself to respect norms like establish in the book "Clean Code" by Robert C.Martin. Which I recomand you if you haven't read it yet.
As developper, I try to produce the simplest code as possible, or I try because I'm a junior and I still have to learn.
Therefore, I think the "less the better" and "the simpler the better". 

It's no use to try to show off how smart you are by coding something only you can understand.
Though the code will compile proprely, the side effect will be tangible on longterm as well as it'll be tough to collaborate with you in a team.

The Code I wanna produce follow norms of "Clean Code". So please If you are a recruiter take time to get a look to my repository and simply read a few of code.
I'm not asking for a full review project but to make you an opinion on my skills, so that you can assess if I'm the candidat that'll fit your need. 

If you have any suggestions about my code, or anything that would help me to enhance it, I would appreciate your feedback.
